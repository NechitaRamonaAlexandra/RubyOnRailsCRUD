# README

This was the first attempt at creating a web page and also my first time working with ruby. It is a website that Contains lists of movies with short information about them and a comment section for each movie. It only implements CRUD on the movies database and a search operation.  

Although it was a small project, it was interesting to make a parallel between other programming languages I have learned and ruby, and the site can be improved with tons of functionality if I decide to revisit the project.

Main highlights of the application:

* Listing movies (with afferent descriptions) from a database

* Adding a new movie

* Editing an existing movie

* Deleting a movie

* Searching for a specific movie

* MVC Architecture

* Researched into security (not actually implemented)
